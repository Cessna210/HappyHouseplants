Never allow a bamboo palm to sit in the excess water that drains from the pot. Do not use water that has passed through a softener because the high salt content damages the leaves. Leaf tips look pale in color and green leaves fall off when a bamboo palm is over-watered. New growth and leaf tips turn brown when a bamboo palm is under-watered. The confusing thing is that yellow leaves can develop when the plant is over or under- watered, so you need to check the soil as far down as you can to know if the plant needs water."

    "summary": "A Bromeliad fasciata (Aechmea fasciata), sometimes called a Silver Vase plant or Urn plant, is an easy care flowering plant native to Brazil. In nature, it is an epiphytic plant, which means it grows on other plants or trees. This bromeliad variety has thick, arching, gray-green leaves.These unique leaves are arranged in a circular fashion so that they form an upturned waxy cup in the center. This central cup, or reservoir collects the water and nutrients that the plant needs. After three or four years, as a Bromeliad fasciata matures, the plant produces a tall flower stalk with numerous pink bracts. The real flowers are small blue blooms that grow between the pink bracts. Although the blue flowers quickly die, the bright pink bracts often last 5 or 6 months. When buying a Bromeliad fasciata, avoid purchasing one that already has small blue flowers since this indicates the pink bracts have been visible for a while and may soon fade.\u00a0",

A Fishtail Palm has fan shaped fronds with bipinate smaller leaves. This means that there is a main leaf stem on a Fishtail Palm but the leaves come off of a secondary stem.

You can also use a  well- balanced houseplant food at 1/3-1/4 the recommended strength."

      "comment": "The easiest way to kill any Orchid Plant is by over-watering. Always allow the top 50% of the potting compost to dry out before watering. Check the roots of an Orchid Plant monthly to be sure they are staying whitish green and plump. Set the plant in a deep saucer of water for about 30 minutes so it can absorb water through the drip holes in the bottom on the pot. Use tepid water that has not passed through a softener (too salty). If your household water has a lot of chemicals in it, allow the water to sit out over night before using it. Type of \u00a0soil, temperature, time of year, humidity, and pot size all influence an orchid plant's watering needs. Orchids dry out a little faster in the winter because of the heat in your home and low humidity."

Root-rot, which causes the plant to die, is the direct result of over\u2013watering. Peperomia plants do well when watered from the bottom. This technique keeps water off of the leaves and helps prevent plant diseases. The thick leaves of a peperomia hold water and allow it to withstand long periods without moisture."

    "summary": "A Poinsettia plant, native to Mexico, is the most popular indoor flowering plant sold in the U.S. even though it is only available six weeks of the year. The colorful parts of a poinsettia are really modified leaves called bracts. Many people mistakenly think the bracts are the flower petals of the plant. Although these bracts are quite attractive they are not part of the flowers. The real flowers are quite inconsequential and are located inside the small yellow part of the poinsettia called a cyathia. There is a cyathia in the center of each group of bracts. Selecting the right poinsettia is the key to having a plant that stays colorful and beautiful the entire holiday season. Ideally there should be green leaves all the way to the soil line. The plant should be well balanced and not top heavy. The real flowers should be barely open, and there should be no pollen on the bracts. Whether you chose the ever popular red poinsettia or any of the many new colors such as white, pink, salmon, yellow, marble, orange, or jingle bells, this is a wonderful holiday plant that can sit on a table, be trained as a small tree, or be placed in a frame with 20-50 other poinsettias to form a magnificent huge poinsettia Christmas Tree. There are even hanging baskets of poinsettias available. Poinsettias, despite all rumors, are only very mildly  poisonousPlants are a great addition to homes and offices, but it\u2019s important to know whether your plants are dangerous to children, pets, or even adults. Some plants contain chemicals such as oxalates, solanine, glycosides, or alkaloid lycorine that may cause vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, swelling and redness of the mouth, throat, and lips, and trouble breathing. Touching parts of certain plants, especially the sap, may cause various skin irritations. The weight and age of the human or pet involved, and the part and amount of plant eaten determine how severe the reaction to the toxins will be. Although plants may be listed as non-toxic, they can still cause individual allergic reactions. If there is any question after a houseplant has been ingested or touched immediately call the Poison Control Center 1-800-222-1222 The Handbook of Poisonous and Injurious Plants [Paperback]is an excellent reference to keep around if you have young children and pets., although the milky sap of the plant may cause minor skin irritations.

These rhizomes are covered in brown, hairy- looking  scaleSoft Brown Scale is the most common scale that attacks indoor houseplants especially ficus, ivy, spider plants, ferns, aralia, and schefflera. It appears as small bumpy brown spots that appear to move. As the scale sucks on the sap of the plant it secretes a sticky substance called honeydew. The honeydew attracts black mildew. Because of the shell-like exterior, sprays are only partially effective against scale.

These plants have the nickname shamrock plant because of their three, thin, triangular leaflets that look like a lucky clover plant. There are several stories associated with the shamrock plant. One of the most popular is that St. Patrick, the saint who brought Christianity to Ireland, picked a shamrock plant from the grass to explain the Holy Trinity to his congregation. The three leaves, he said, represented the father, the son, and the Holy Spirit. St. Patrick\u2019s Day is celebrated on the anniversary of his death. The shamrock plant is also credited with the arrival of spring and as a symbol for the \u201cseason of rebirth.\u201dOxalis regnelli, the green leafed version, has small delicate white flowers; while Oxalis triangularis, or False Shamrock, has dark purple leaves and pinkish lavender flowers.

These slits in the leaves are called cuts. A split leaf philodendron \u00a0grows rapidly and often has leaves that are up to 3ft. long and 2ft. wide. If you want a big, tropical, low maintenance plant, this one is perfect. The leaves, stems, and roots of a split leaf philodendron contain oxalic acid.

Some plants contain chemicals such as oxalates, solanine, glycosides, or alkaloid lycorine that may cause vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, swelling and redness of the mouth, throat, and lips, and trouble breathing. Touching parts of certain plants, especially the sap, may cause various skin irritations. The weight and age of the human or pet involved, and the part and amount of plant eaten determine how severe the reaction to the toxins will be. Although plants may be listed as non-toxic, they can still cause individual allergic reactions.

An area that is too hot and dry encourages Spider Mites and causes blooms to quickly fade. A northern exposure really doesn't provide enough light for high light plants. These plants need to be placed directly in front of an east-facing window, within 1-3 feet of a west-facing window, and within 5 ft. of a south facing window. A high light area has over 300 ft. candles of light.. The zebrina variety has long vines covered in small stemless leaves about 2\u201d in length. The colorful patterned leaves are green with purple stripes and a silver shine. The underside of the leaf is a deep purple or magenta color. There are other varieties of Wandering Jew plants that have pink, off -white, or a bronze stripe in their leaves. The \u201cfluminensis\u201d Wandering Jew plant has small, solid green leaves and white flowers while the \u201cpalida\u201d variety has purple leaves with white, purple, or pink flowers.
